# Binary-Star-System

Simulation of a Binary Star System with two planets in Python using Matplotlib library. 

Gravitational forces of interaction amongst all pairs if bodies was used to calculate the trajectories of the bodies. The system consists of two planets as well, revolvilng around the two stars. The shadow of the moving bodies was projected onto a 2D plane.
